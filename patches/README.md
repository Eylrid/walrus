Patches
=======

`add_preview_msg_button.patch`

Adds a button next to 'send' that when pressed loads the contents of the composed message into the inbox message view panel, as Richtext.

This makes testing formatted messages easier

`forcehtml_context_menu.patch`

Adds an action to the inbox's right-click menu that forces a message to be viewed as Richtext.

This makes viewing mailing list messages possible.

__This has been incorporated into PyBitmessage__ :)
